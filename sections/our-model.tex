Having explored existing data models and tested their limitations against several case studies from the Middle Ages, we propose a model with the entities and relationships represented in Figure \ref{fig:ProposedEntities}. To begin, we present all the entities we believe necessary for a data model tasked with organizing and delivering information about texts and traditions in Medieval literature, particularly texts about chivalric tales and legends. Then, we list all the attributes each entity features. Compared to the former, this latter section is more likely to need renegotiation based on the idiosyncratic qualities of different literary corpora.

\subsection{Entity relationships}

In Section \ref{sec:basicER}, we start by simply introducing the entities' names and the nature of their relationships to one another. Subsequently, we present a technical schematic of the entities' relationships to one another.

\subsubsection{Nature of the relationships between entities}
\label{sec:basicER}

In Figure \ref{fig:ProposedEntities}, we see that one \textit{Cycle} can be a part of another \textit{Cycle} via the foreign-key relationship ``is part of.'' This is case when one the subject of one \textit{Cycle}, such as \textit{Works} about Charlemagne's knight Agolant, can also be interpretted as being a part of a larger \textit{Cycle}, such as a \textit{Cycle} about Charlemagne broadly. Thus, due to \textit{Cycles'} potential inter-entity connections, the same relationship ``is part of'' applies to \textit{Cycles} and to \textit{Works}. In our proposed model, a \textit{Cycle} can have only one parent \textit{Cycle} and a \textit{Work} belongs to the tradition of only one \textit{Cycle}. Both of these relationships are optional.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\caption{Proposed Entities}
\label{fig:ProposedEntities}
\end{figure}

The \textit{Text} entity can have five relationships, three of which originate from it, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:ProposedEntities}. First, a \textit{Text} must relate to one and only one \textit{Work}. According to our definition, the \textit{Text} is the expression in a certain human language and literary style of a \textit{Work}. One \textit{Text} can be modeled on or the translation of an anterior \textit{Text}. Furthermore, a \textit{Text} can optionally be related to one or more \textit{Person} entities. The latter can be responsible either for authoring the \textit{Text} or for translating it. Finally, a \textit{Text} should have at least one \textit{Witness} or \textit{Attested Witness} relate to it; otherwise, we would have no evidence of the abstract \textit{Text} entity's existence. However, the relationship between a \textit{Text} and either of the two types of witnesses (extant \textit{Witness} and lost \textit{Attested Witness}) stems from the latter and is not a requirement for the \textit{Text} entity.

Originating from the extant \textit{Witness} are potentially five types of entity relationships. First and foremost, a \textit{Witness} must relate to one and only one \textit{Text}. By definition, a \textit{Witness} is a version of the text's linguistic content, spelled out in a sequence of characters, as demonstrated in Table \ref{tab:TextVersions}. Second, the \textit{Witness}, by virtue of being extant and not a lost \textit{Attested Witness}, must be visible on the \textit{Pages} of an \textit{Archival Item}. When it has survived through fragments, one \textit{Witness} can relate to another through the attribute ``is preceded by.'' This is the case when one fragment is presumed to have come after another fragment, as demonstrated in the Table \ref{tab:CampsAspremont}.

Finally, and again optionally, a \textit{Witness} can have formerly been contained in a document which has not survived but to whose historical existence scholars attest based on philological and codicological evidence. The latter document is the entity \textit{Attested Document} and it receives a relationship from one or more \textit{Witnesses} that it is alleged to have transmitted together. The \textit{Attested Document} can also have contained a lost \textit{Attested Witness}. As sometimes mentioned in archival catalogues, an extant \textit{Witness} might have been modeled on a presumed version of a \textit{Text} that has since been lost, an \textit{Attested Witness}. As such, a \textit{Witness} can have a relationship to an \textit{Attested Witness}.

\textit{Pages} represents an uninterrupted set of pages and, when digitized, images of an \textit{Archival Item} on which the text content of a \textit{Witness} can be read. In our data model, a \textit{Pages} entity, which depends on an extant \textit{Witness}, must be contained in an \textit{Archival Item}. The \textit{Archival Item} can relate to multiple \textit{Pages} entities. However, the first folio of one \textit{Pages} entity must not come before the last folio of another \textit{Pages} entity in the same \textit{Archival Item}. In other words, \textit{Pages} entities cannot overlap. They represent a unique set of leafs or pages in an \textit{Archival Item}, and they present the content of only one \textit{Witness}. Lastly, the \textit{Archival Item}, being an object one can consult and which continues to persist, contrary to the \textit{Attested Document}, must be conserved in a \textit{Repository}.
