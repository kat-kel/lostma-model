The data model must be adaptable yet consistent. Users should be able to request collections of linked resources regardless the genre or language of the works involved. Furthermore, they should be able to combine repertories through shared vocabularies and metadata fields. As such, we face an age-old dilemna. We are pulled between being specific and idiosyncratic, on the one hand, and being simple and generalizable on the other. To confront this issue, we first turn to other successful data models. From those precedents, we adopt a hierarchical approach and certain ontological distinctions, notably distinctions between a \textit{Work} (the story), a \textit{Text} (a telling of the story), and a \textit{Witness} (a written version of that telling).
