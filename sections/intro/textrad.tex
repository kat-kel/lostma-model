More recently this century, Patrick Sahle has developed a set of entity relationships that have significantly impacted the fields of philology and textual criticism.\footcite{Sahle2013} At the core of his wheel model (\textit{Textrad}), which we illustrate as a triangle in Figure \ref{fig:Textrad}, Sahle deconstructs the idea of a text into three primary dimensions: text as a story's ideal content \brackettext{\textit{Inhalt}}, not mediated by anything (\textbf{I}); text as a story's linguistic content \brackettext{\textit{sprachlichem Gehalt}}, mediated through human language (\textbf{S}); and text as a physical document \brackettext{\textit{Dokument}} (\textbf{D}) on which a story's content is materially represented.

Between the main spokes of the text-wheel (\textit{Textrad}), as seen in Figure \ref{fig:TextradAll}, Sahle includes three other dimensions: text as a set of signs (\textit{Zeichen}), text as a structured sequence of content (\textit{Werk}), and text as a version (\textit{Fassung}). Sahle's embedded dimensions make certain assertions about texts. For example, changes in a text's linguistic content (\textbf{S}), such as translating \textit{Beowulf} from Old English to contemporary Italian, will produce a new version (\textbf{F}) of the text, which will in turn produce a different physical document (\textbf{D}). However, changing \textit{Beowulf} from Old English to contemporary Italian does not necessarily change the work (\textbf{W}) \textit{Beowulf} itself, which still features the same organizing structure of the content of the \textit{Beowulf} story (\textbf{I}).

Sahle avoids ascribing the term ``text'' to any one entity within the text-wheel. However, as Frédéric Duval notes, many scholars in the fields of philology, textual criticism, and scholarly editions habitually rely on the term ``text'' as well as ``work'' and ``document.'' Attempting to make explicit many scholars' and editors' implied typologies, Duval summarizes the state of the field as such:
\begin{quote}
    ``\brackettext{\textit{W}}\textit{ork} designates the author's text, eventually the text corresponding to the author's intention, and implies authenticity; \textit{text} denotes the linguistic sequence, which is attested in the document that is transmitting the work; finally \textit{document} is a physical manifestation of a text.''
    \footcite[``\textit{work} désigne le texte de l'auteur, éventuellement le texte correspondant à la volonté de l'auteur, et implique la notion d'authenticité ; \textit{text} dénomme la séquence linguistique attestée dans un document transmettant l'œuvre ; enfin \textit{document} est une manifestation physique d'un text''][16]{Duval2017}
\end{quote}

\noindent In Figure \ref{fig:DuvalTypes}, we overlay the typologies of Sahle's text-wheel with Duval's summary of the mainstream typology used in textual criticism and scholarly editing.

\end{figure}

In seeking to resolve terminological discrepancies between the fields of textual criticism and scholarly editing, Duval introduces a new discrepancy between his concept of \textit{work} and Sahle's \textit{Werke} concept. Given his focus on articulating the tripartite \textit{work}-\textit{text}-\textit{document} concerns of textual criticism and scholarly editions, this is not a problem for Duval. Sahle's concept of a work (\textit{Werke}), which is not yet mediated through any human language or literary style, is not typically the subject of scholarly editions or close textual readings. Such endeavors focus on what Sahle would call linguistic content (\textbf{S}).
