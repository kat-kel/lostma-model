The Encoded Archival Standards (EAD) is an international set of bibliographic protocols whose first definitive version, 1.0, was recently released in 2024. When encoded in EAD, the item's electronic record has two main components: information about the record itself (\texttt{<control>}), and information about the archival item (\texttt{<archdesc>}). The latter is relevant to the resources in LostMa's data model and includes the following sections:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Descriptive Identifier (\texttt{<did>}) : identifies the constitution of the archival item and other identifying information
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Title
        \item Author
        \item Date
        \item Repository
        \item Language
    \end{itemize}
    \item Scope Content (\texttt{<scopecontent>}) : meaningfully describes the content in the archival item
\end{itemize}
